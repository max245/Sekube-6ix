Introduction
As part of this project, select monitoring tools were validated to measure the security services provided by them.  In addition to the single monitor tools, log monitoring stacks were deployed in each kubernetes environment. The Kubernetes Security monitoring infrastructure project's minimum viable product implementation uses the open-source framework components, including ELK stack and EFK stack. The custom login to the product entry point  use SSO federated login methodology for authentication



The project is validated in 3 different environments 

1.	GCP- GKE
2.	Linode Cloud Platform â€“ LKE
3.	On premise simulated environment using vagrant

-	Use the respective playbooks to select your deployment of choice and continue the validation 

-	Test Applications used to validate the security of Kubernetes environment are a single page node application and a java application . Use the corresponding files from Giuthub and follow the directions in the playbook
